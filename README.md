## Part of My Ph.D. Dissertation at University of South Carolina

### Introduction
Medical researchers are often interested in modeling the disease infection status of individuals to identify important risk factors and to estimate subject-specific risk probabilities. In many cases, pooling specimens (e.g., blood, urine, swabs, etc.) through group testing offers a novel approach to significantly reduce the number of tests, the time expended, and the overall costs. This has led to the adoption of group testing in a number of infectious disease applications

### Methodology
In this paper, we develop new group testing regression methods for analyzing multiple-disease screening data with imperfect diagnostic tests.
### Conclusions
To be continue.
