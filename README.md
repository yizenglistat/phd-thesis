### Introduction
Medical researchers are often interested in modeling the disease infection status of individuals to identify important risk factors and to estimate subject-specific risk probabilities. In many cases, pooling specimens (e.g., blood, urine, swabs, etc.) through group testing offers a novel approach to significantly reduce the number of tests, the time expended, and the overall costs. This has led to the adoption of group testing in a number of infectious disease applications

### Usage
Main `R` scripts are stored under `R/` folder and the `run.r` generates outputs (figures) under `output/` folder. The `/data/` folder contains `raw.csv`, `processed.csv` and `data_clean.r`. 

```
.
+-- R/
|   +-- *.r
+-- output
|   +-- application/
|       +-- figures/
|			+-- *.png
|       +-- output_*.txt
|   +-- simulation/

+-- run.r
+-- README.md
```

### Conclusions
