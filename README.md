### Introduction
Medical researchers are often interested in modeling the disease infection status of individuals to identify important risk factors and to estimate subject-specific risk probabilities. In many cases, pooling specimens (e.g., blood, urine, swabs, etc.) through group testing offers a novel approach to significantly reduce the number of tests, the time expended, and the overall costs. This has led to the adoption of group testing in a number of infectious disease applications

### Usage
```
.
+-- R
+-- output
|   +-- application
|       +-- figures/
|       +-- output_(seednumber).txt
|   +-- simulation
|       +-- figures/
|       +-- output_(seednumber).txt
+-- run.r
